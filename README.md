# dotfiles

Config and setup stuff for Arch systems. I have no idea if this is a "proper" dotfiles but it works.

Run stuff in `scripts/` from the root directory of this repo.

Note that when updating bashrc you will need to create a new bash session yourself to reflect the changes. 

## Manual things to do:

- Change Konsole default shell to Bash (it ignores the user's default shell)
